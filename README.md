```

Inspired by a talk on [The Clean Architecture in Python](https://archive.org/details/pyvideo_2840___The_Clean_Architecture_in_Python)
by Brandon Rhodes, `drf-pipeline-views` aims to simplify writing testable API endpoints with
[Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) using the
*[Pipeline Design Pattern](https://java-design-patterns.com/patterns/pipeline/)*.

The main idea behind the pipeline pattern is to process data in steps. Input from the previous step
is passed to the next, resulting in a collection of data-in, data-out functions. These functions
can be easily unit tested, since none of the functions depend on the state of the objects in the other parts
of the pipeline. Furthermore, IO can be separated into its own step, making the other parts of the
logic simpler and faster to test by not having to mock or do any other special setup around the IO.
This also means that the IO block, or in fact any other part of the application, can be replaced as long as the
data flowing through the pipeline remains the same.


## Basic Usage:

Let's create a basic pipeline:

```python
def step1(step1_input1, step1_input2):
    # Process the data...
    return {"step2_input1": ..., "step2_input2": ...}

def step2(step2_input1, step2_input2):
    # Maybe do some IO...
    return {"step3_input1": ..., "step3_input2": ...}

def step3(step3_input1, step3_input2):
    # Process the data, but do not pass on anything...
    return

def step4():
    # Build some response...
    return {"end_result1": ..., "end_result2": ...}
```

Next, we'll create input and output serializers for our endpoint:

```python
from rest_framework import fields
from rest_framework.serializers import Serializer

class InputSerializer(Serializer):
    step1_input1 = fields.CharField()
    step1_input2 = fields.DateField()

class OutputSerializer(Serializer):
    end_result1 = fields.CharField()
    end_result2 = fields.FloatField()
```

Finally, we can create our view:

```python
from pipeline_views import BaseAPIView, GetMixin


class SomeView(GetMixin, BaseAPIView):

  pipelines = {
    "GET": [
        InputSerializer,
        [
            step1,
            step2,
            step3,
            step4,
        ],
        OutputSerializer,
    ],
  }
```

Using input and output serializers like this forces verification of the incoming and outcoming data,
so that if something changes in the logic, or some unexpected values are returned,
the endpoint will break instead of creating side effects in the application using the API.

---

Using serializers is totally optional. A pipeline like this will work just as well:

```python
class SomeView(GetMixin, BaseAPIView):

  pipelines = {
    "GET": [
        step1,
        step2,
        step3,
        step4,
    ],
  }
```

BaseAPIView will try to infer a serializer with the correct serializer fields for
based on the type hints to the first function `step1`.

```python
from rest_framework.fields import CharField, IntegerField
from pipeline_views import MockSerializer

# Callable
def logic_callable(name: str, age: int):
    ...

# Inferred Serializer
class LogicCallableSerializer(MockSerializer):
    name = CharField()
    age = IntegerField()
```

This is only used by the Django REST Framework Browsable API to create forms.
`MockSerializer` makes sure the fields are only used for input and not validation.

Pipeline logic can be grouped into blocks:

```python
class SomeView(GetMixin, BaseAPIView):

  pipelines = {
    "GET": [
        [
            block1_step1,
            block1_step2,
        ],
        [
            block2_step1,
            block2_step2,
        ],
    ],
  }
```

Logic blocks are useful if you want to skip some logic methods under certain conditions, e.g., to return a cached result.
This can be accomplished by raising a `NextLogicBlock` exception. The exception can be initialized with
any number of keyword arguments that will be passed to the next step in the logic, or to the response if it's
the last step in the logic.

```python
from pipeline_views import NextLogicBlock


def block1_step1(step1_input1, step1_input2):
    if condition:
        raise NextLogicBlock(step3_input1=..., step3_input2=...)
    ...

def block1_step2(step2_input1, step2_input2):
    ...

def block2_step1(step3_input1, step3_input2):
    ...

def block2_step2():
    ...
```

If you wish to add data to a request, you can do that on the endpoint level by overriding
`_process_request`, or on the endpoint HTTP method level by overriding the spesific method, like `get`.

```python
from rest_framework.exceptions import NotAuthenticated
from rest_framework.authentication import get_authorization_header
from pipeline_views import BaseAPIView, GetMixin


class BasicView(GetMixin, BaseAPIView):

    pipelines = {"GET": ...}

    def get(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        # Add language to every get request for this endpoint
        kwargs["lang"] = request.LANGUAGE_CODE
        return super().get(request, *args, **kwargs)

    def _process_request(self, data):
        # Add authorization token to every http method
        data["token"] = self._token_from_headers()
        return super()._process_request(data)

    def _token_from_headers(self):
        auth_header = get_authorization_header(self.request)
        if not auth_header:
            raise NotAuthenticated("You must be logged in for this endpoint.")
        return auth_header.split()[1].decode()
```
